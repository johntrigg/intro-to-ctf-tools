## picoCTF 13

Rot13 cipher, as implied by the name. Go to cyberchef, and plug in rot13 decode for a flag

## picoCTF Caesar

A caesar cipher is functionally rot13, but with a different offset. Go to cyberchef, plug in rot13, and play around with the offset.

## picoCTF vigenere

A caesar cipher, but more complicated and with a key. Ie a key of "with" shifts 1st letter by w, 2nd by i, 3rd with t, and 4th with h. Go to cyberchef, select vigenere decode, and enter the key.

## picoCTF the numbers

Functionally a cipher where 1 is a, 2 is b, and so on. Cyberchef has an option for this (a1z26), but it should auto detect.

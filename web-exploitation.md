The challenge name tells us one thing: this will be related to SQL injection. We start the instance, and because it's a web exploitation challenge, we open up Burpsuite. We are greeted with a login page.

We activate Burpsuite intercept and its proxy. We send a sample login request and capture the request. Burpsuite provides a handy "intruder" feature, which allows us to send payloads in a specific part of a request. We send the request to intruder, clear the auto-detected payloads, and tell Burpsuite that the test for "username" is our payload. We switch over to the "payload" section, and we want to pick a wordlist of potential payloads. I used seclists/SQLi/quick-SQLi.txt
